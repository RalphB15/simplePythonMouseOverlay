# simplePythonMouseOverlay

This is a simple python script to add a cross-hair overlay to your mouse. I use it for EVE Online to make my cursor more visible. (Scaling issues when playing in 4K)

Make sure to install all dependencies.

Note, the in-game cursor is **still visible**. But for me this was enough to be satisfied in EVE, because it's microscopic...
